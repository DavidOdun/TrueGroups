This is TrueGroups. We are helping to make academic groups better by curating the teams that bring out the best attributes of every 
member. 

For many students, being in the right group is important, and it defines their success throughout the semester. Picking these groups can
be easy for some students, as they generally choose their friends, or they already know who their high performing group is composed of.
However, too often, this process of group formation is a dreaded uncomfortable task that results in a long and frustrating group session
or even semester. There must be some reform, and there must be a better process of formation that results in more high-performing,
low friction groups.

TrueGroups is a tool that will solve this problem. TrueGroups is a web platform that has students register with classes and organizations 
where they are then grouped with students who will help them perform the task at the highest performance level. TrueGroups will
make frustrating group-making a thing of the past. Students will fill out a short survey that will help us decide which group they belong
in, and then the algorithm will take it from there.

However, it doesn't end there. Solving this group formation process is no easy feat, and we are seeking your help in its development. As 
better survey questions are discovered or more features are needed in the platform, we ask that you take part in its implementation. 
We at TrueGroups believe that together, we can create groups of the future.
