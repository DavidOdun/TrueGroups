TrueGroups is a platform that allows professors and other group organizers to group members 
in such a way that maximizes productivity and engagement. Members of the larger organization
or class answer several questions that allow us to understand who they are and what
type of group they would be most productive in. After students members join a class or organization,
the group organizer then requests for TrueGroups to create groups using the 
pool. The organizer and the members will then receive their group assignment.
